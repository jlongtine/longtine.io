To stabilize. 

To grow in strength. 

To find stillness and power within. 

And to feed those spring blossoms. 

This is a time to play a big game. To find ways to thrive in the midst of chaos. 

To build strength. For what may come. For the worst. Or the best. Because even if the worst does not come, we can still use that strength. That power. We can let this be a catalyst for our potential. Let it strip away the facade, reveal our fears, worries, panic. And meet them. Let the intensity of the situation serve as a lens to magnify, amplify, expand our understanding of the nuances of those things. This is a moment that creates a caricature of how our system responds. 

We can take full advantage of that caricature. 

And we can also use the odd stillness of this moment to take the time to listen, to learn, to grow.
