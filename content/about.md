I build things. I try to build beautiful, lasting, effective things. In as many parts of my life as possible.

I explore my reality and try to understand it as deeply as I'm able.

### Career

I've largely lived in the early-stage startup world. I love to bring order to chaos. To discover and understand and solve problems. 

I've done Ruby on Rails development, Python Machine learning (lots of matrix multiplication), and most recently, DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering.

I've primarily worked in AWS, but use and build systems using Kubernetes for container orchestration.
